This gem is starting off as a mostly-straightforward port of [learnsanskrit.org's Sanscript.js](https://github.com/sanskrit/sanscript.js), and will go from there. It also incorporates transliteration scheme detection based on [learnsanskrit.org's Detect.js](https://github.com/sanskrit/detect.js).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sanscript'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sanscript

## Usage

You can access detection through `Sanscript.detect(text)` and transliteration through `Sanscript.transliterate(text, from, to)`.

Documentation is provided in YARD format and available online at [rubydoc.info](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/ubcsanskrit/sanscript.rb).

## Development
